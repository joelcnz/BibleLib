Matthew 28:18 -- And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
19 Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
 -- All authuraty(sp). baptising in the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit

2 Timothy 3:14 -- But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it
15 and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

2 Timothy 4:5 -- As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

2 Timothy 4:17 -- But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

Luke 10:1 -- After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go.
2 And he said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.
3 Go your way; behold, I am sending you out as lambs in the midst of wolves.
4 Carry no moneybag, no knapsack, no sandals, and greet no one on the road.
5 Whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace be to this house!'
6 And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if not, it will return to you.
7 And remain in the same house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer deserves his wages. Do not go from house to house.
8 Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.
9 Heal the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.'
10 But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,
11 'Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.'
12 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
13 "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
14 But it will be more bearable in the judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you.
15 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades.
16 "The one who hears you hears me, and the one who rejects you rejects me, and the one who rejects me rejects him who sent me."
17 The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!"

Book: T4T, A Disciplesship ReRevolution, by Steve Smith with Ying Kai
Acts 10:6 -- He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside."
7 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,
8 and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
9 The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
10 And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance
11 and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
12 In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
13 And there came a voice to him: "Rise, Peter; kill and eat."
14 But Peter said, "By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
15 And the voice came to him again a second time, "What God has made clean, do not call common."
16 This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
17 Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate
18 and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
19 And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
20 Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them."
21 And Peter went down to the men and said, "I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"
22 And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say."
23 So he invited them in to be his guests.The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
24 And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.
26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am a man."
27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.
28 And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.
29 So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me."
30 And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing
31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
32 Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.'
33 So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."
34 So Peter opened his mouth and said: "Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,
35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
36 As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),
37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.

Mark 16:15 -- And he said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.

Lets us be doweres of the Word, and not hearers only.

24:00 - Things happened because you prayed.
Matthew 6:5 -- "And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.
6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
7 "And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
9 Pray then like this: "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
10 Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
11 Give us this day our daily bread,
12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
14 For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you,
15 but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

2 Samuel 11:1 -- In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel. And they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.
2 It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful.
3 And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, "Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
4 So David sent messengers and took her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been purifying herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned to her house.
5 And the woman conceived, and she sent and told David, "I am pregnant."
6 So David sent word to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent Uriah to David.
7 When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab was doing and how the people were doing and how the war was going.
8 Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." And Uriah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.
9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
10 When they told David, "Uriah did not go down to his house," David said to Uriah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"
11 Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."
12 Then David said to Uriah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
13 And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk. And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.
14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
15 In the letter he wrote, "Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die."
16 And as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.
17 And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uriah the Hittite also died.
18 Then Joab sent and told David all the news about the fighting.
19 And he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,
20 then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?
21 Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.'"
22 So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him to tell.
23 The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.
24 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king's servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also."
25 David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Joab, 'Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another. Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it.' And encourage him."
26 When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she lamented over her husband.
27 And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.

God's workmanship
Ephesians 2:10 -- For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
 - For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
The product of His workmanship. We are his workmanship.
Ephesians 2:1 -- And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience--
3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.

Ephesians 2:8 -- For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

Isaiah 64:8 -- But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.
 - all the work of His hand.
We must allow God you mold us.
Job 10:8 -- Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether.
9 Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust?

Some parts of the clay must be removed. And it hurts.
Romans 9:17 -- For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
18 So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
19 You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"
20 But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?"
21 Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for dishonorable use?
22 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
23 in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory--

God has a purpose for us.
We are to confess things to God, take things to God.
1 Corinthians 3:12 -- Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--
13 each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.


We are his workmanship:
Ephesians 2:10 -- For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

Unto good works, not by good works.
Matthew 5:16 -- In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
 -- our works are to glorify God, not for us.
We all are molded differently.

The point of His workmanship:
His creation, His masterpiece.
2 Timothy 2:20 -- Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.
21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.
22 So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.

We need to allow God to take control. It's not easy to do so.

1) God has the power and wisdom and willingness and love to take care of you and I.
2 Timothy 1:12 -- which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me.

2 Timothy 1:7 -- for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

 -- lean not unto thine own understanding.
Ephesians 4:30 -- And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
 -- not giving God control

3) How to we give up our lives into God's hand.
Acts 5:1 -- But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,
2 and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.
3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?
4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."
 -- we must be willing for God to have control

4) Letting go or allowing God to take control, is one of the hardest things for us to do.
Hebrews 11:6 -- And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

God will comfort

Isaiah 59:1 -- Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save, or his ear dull, that it cannot hear;
2 but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.


1) Personal sin must be deal with.
Psalms 66:18 -- If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.

Maybe sin of Bible neglect.

2) We must make much of God's book.
Proverbs 28:9 -- If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.

How much of God's to you read, how much do you study it how often do we meditate on it.
John 15:7 -- If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

Memorise God's work.
Matthew 5:23 -- So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
24 leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.


3) Have a right relationship with your fellow man.
1 John 5:14 -- And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.
 
Luke 11:5 -- And he said to them, "Which of you who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves,

Luke 18:1 -- And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart.
2 He said, "In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man.
3 And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, 'Give me justice against my adversary.'
4 For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I neither fear God nor respect man,
5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.'"

Not praying for our Brothers. How is your prayer life, Christian?
We need to pray till the answer comes.

The A-Z in Christian growth.
You can not loose your salvation.
There's teaching that you can't be sure of going to be with God.
Romans 8:38 -- For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,

Psalms 119:130 -- The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.
 (maybe a bug in my program) 
1 Corinthians 2:14 -- The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.

Mans natural state is not to desire God.
But he him self is judged of no man.
Fed with milk not meat because of being carnal(sp).
1) Lowest level is the non Christian.
2) Middle level in God's eyes, is the carnal Christian. Lives in two worlds, heavenly and earthly.
3) Highest level in God's eyes is the spiritual Christian.
To be a Christian you have to have a desire for God.

Ephesians 1:3 -- Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,

One needs to be born into God's family.
Ephesians 1:7 -- In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,

All the Bible is climaxed at the cross and being raised again.
How by the blood? It is far from our understanding.
We put Christ on the cross. He said Father forgive them for they know no what they do.
Atonment means to cover.
We come to church, but has your sins been forgiven? Do you know for sure if you die you will go to heaven?
We are on the winning side. We have nothing to complain about.

Psalms 32:1 -- Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
2 Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
3 For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
4 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah
5 I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah
6 Therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him.
7 You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah
8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
9 Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, or it will not stay near you.
10 Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the LORD.
11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!

Psalms 32:8 -- I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
 -- verse that helped me, in getting to know the will of God. kept coming accross it again and again. Guide thee with mine eye.
God's hand is not short to help us, but our sin gets in the way.
What happens when we disobey(sp). God disoplines(sp). ({does he chasetise us when we do good too?})
We need to keep in right fellowship with God. Turn from things we know are wrong, and turn to the things we know are good.
We need God's guidance(sp). Sorrows come with the way of the wicked, so we don't want to go the way of the wicked.

|_Psal 1 -- delights in the law of the Lord
2 Peter 3:9 -- The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.

We should learn to be content.
The Lord will reward those who diligently seek Him.

Galatians 6:7 -- Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
8 For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
9 And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
 -- be not decieved .. reap life everlasting. Don't grow weary in doing good.
What we so we shall also reap. If we sow to the flesh, we'll reap corruption.
Reaping what is sowen(sp).

John 3:16 -- "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

Romans 10:5 -- For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
6 But the righteousness based on faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" (that is, to bring Christ down)
7 or "'Who will descend into the abyss?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
8 But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
11 For the Scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."
12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.
13 For "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."

Romans 6:22 -- But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.

3 but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
4 But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die.
5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.
7 Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.

9 But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"
10 And he said, "I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself."
11 He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"
12 The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."
13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
14 The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
15 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."
16 To the woman he said, "I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."
17 And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
18 thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
19 By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return."

Curse on those not loving the Lord Jesus.
Galatians 4:21 -- Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman.
23 But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.
24 Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
27 For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband."
28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
29 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
30 But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman."
31 So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.

5:02 - Start of restful increase.
365 - promises for fear not.
Power, love, and sound mind.
If you are not restful, your fearful.
Enter My rest.
Things of unbelief.
Hebrews 4:1 -- Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.
2 For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.
3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest,'"although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.

There are unbelieving believers.
Hebrews 4:9 -- So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
10 for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.
11 Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.

Active life, but restful.
If you don't work, you are worse than an infidel(sp).
Sabbath is from 6pm to Sat 6pm.
Year of restful increase (2010).
Genesis 1:5 -- God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

23:12 - rest study. Man sleep 10 hours without the light bulb.
3rd piorty(sp) is sleep.
Genesis 1:8 -- And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.

It is a privage for us to partisapate(sp) with God.
Genesis 2:2 -- And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
3 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.

28:45 - Rest is holy. The law of first mention.
Colossians 2:16 -- Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.
17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.

30:30 - To eat the food must die. Be cooked. And consumed. The olive and grapes must be crushed, like Christ.
No evening and morning on the 7th day.
32:50 - when sleeping people got things from God. Are we sleeping enough?
Rest is not just pysical(sp). Rest is directed activity. Walking instead of sitting can be restful, (having sat for 38 years with no walking).
John 5:16 -- And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
17 But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working until now, and I am working."

Don't feel that every thing depends on me.
40:10 - So I need to let my hair rest. ;-)

Matthew 11:28 -- Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

God gives us rest in our conscience. Deep deep down. Emotions, mind, and soul. If your soul prospers your body prospers.
48:20 - Gentle is strength under control.
50:50 - The people who proud, get hurt the most.
Yoke but rest.

Got gets glory out of bad things happening.

It's no longer about me, it's no long about my glory.
It's a journey. The only option is to follow God.
He too asked the question (Jesus). 'If this cup should pass.' It's ok to ask, ok to pray. God wants us to pray.
Accused(sp) Him, railroaded Him. Look through the lens that Christ looked through with the cross.

12 He said, "But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
13 Then Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
14 God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
15 God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.

My mullett:
Oh, yes the hair cut, forgot about that. I had hair down near to my eyes before that. A friend said he'd cut it. I just wanted a trim around the edges, but the sissors weren't much good. Then I thought get certain cuts and take photos, but my "friend" did what ever he liked. I knew Timothy was still working on his show, so I left the back meaning to come back later for it to be finished. The guy Damian is away for a while now.

I think why I've keeped it, is because there are people that really like it, and think I suit it. Including a flat mate and Rosemary (she thinks I should grow it longer and have a pony tail).  I don't think it's flash either, but maybe for the sake of the people that like it I could compromise by getting it cut later. Or get it cut on Monday (asap, after I get up), and can say some people find it horrible, which isn't a very good balance. Have a hair cut that isn't loved or hated.

Forget Timothy's guitar playing and singing. Check out my hair cut!

I went out and ran at a car full tilt. Then jumped aside, thoughing my hands up. I heard some screams. I ran after another car, but it was too fast. Then I think I just walked up the right side of the road on foot. Ended up talking to a lady through her car window, across the road from the police station. She said I would be slower than cars, and I sort of said I had just found that already. I then walked on the foot path on the left. Later I got picked up by police, it was wet, they took me back to the hostel.
