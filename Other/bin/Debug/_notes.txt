JBible Notes:

(some thing I thought of to go here Grrr..)

notescurrent.txt - the notes file.

Problems with new lines not working (reference list file).

This is made redundant with the GUI stuff:

Edit 'source.txt' and add verse references, on per line.

Valid references (not counting the '-1' one):
Joh 1 1
Eph 2 8 - 9
1Joh 1 1 - -1
1 Joh 1 1 (works as well)

1Joh preduces the whole of chapter one.
