|_1John 5:6 -- This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.
7 -- For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.
8 -- And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.
