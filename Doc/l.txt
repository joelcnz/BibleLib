The first essential is contact with God--the matter of our relationship with God is of supreme importance. 11 |_ It. To be in right relationship with God means to be rich. |_2Corinthians 9:8 - And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work: |_John 15:5 - I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. |_ 1John 3:23 - And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 12 |_ This is a life that will appeal to young people to-day, for there is reality aboutit--it works. There is no expreience like it in all the world. It is a life in vital contact with God, a life of faith, life that believe on the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and as an out come of that belief, shows forth His love to others. |_ "Trusted a million times!" w-- hieroglyphics 13 |_ Because the name sums up the Person. w-- zenith |_Luke 5:5 - And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. 14 |_ to.

Or,. perhaps--and that might be more effective still--we might ask their wives to do it! |_Matthew 6:33 -- But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. |_ 19 -- Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 18 |_ life.

He was not only intellectually converted; he was conveted from head to foot! 20 |_ That. That was all; but it was enough. In factm it was everything. |_ What. He says to each of us: "Follow Me!" and everything of which I depends on our response. |_Luke 5:29 -- And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. |_Matthew 9:10 -- And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. 21 |_ Matthew:.

I do not want your buildings, for the whole of this place is going to ve levelled to the ground. What we want is the site, and on this spot we are going to erect a great power station which is to send elecreicity out into the villages and the cities in the south-east of Ebgland. Away, over in Guildfored, there will be a light shining that is fed from this places. Away yonderm  right down to Dover, they will draw their power from here. We want the situation."
