Rambilings:

I'm on medication that is a pain. They stop me from being selttled. So I go around sick. I lack interest in things, so I don't spend much time thinking on things. I would stop having them, but that would worry people, and I would get into trouble. 'Now I wish upon a star', actually I don't wish for any thing, since my life is great and getting better all the time. The medication is an insault, for some that isn't broke, so why try and fix it. The 'cure' for this 'mental desease' is to get God off the throne of my life, and put myself there inplace of Him. I cann't say I can explain every thing about my actions and what've said, but not every thing is cut and dried. <| My nails need cutting, it's funny typing with longish nails |> I think things will make sence with time. And I'll be found to be the most right. I see with my little mind, stacks and stacks of fun! :-)
