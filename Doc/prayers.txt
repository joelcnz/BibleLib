Lord, help me to get up early. I know feeling I need to stay in be longer is an illustion(sp). I thank you for your goodness.

Lord, you are the creator of the universe. I'm simply part of your creation, but You love me and want to my closest friend. I do not deserve this. I'm part of the fall of man, so am judged guilty and deserving eternal seperation from You, but You in Your love made a way if I excepted it for me to be considered perfect. You sent Your Son to be punished instead of me. So by my excepting Your payment there then is nothing to stop me ulitamitly going to be with You. I thank You for all that You've done, the price that You've payed, the love You have for me. Since You've done so much for me, I should completely serendered to You, be in Your service, seeking only to please You. I should be drawing near to You every day. I should stand out to others, so they want what I have, a relationship with You. I need to keep renewing my mind, so I can see things the way you want me to see them. Though I am positionally perfect, that doesn't make me practially perfect. I still have sinful tendinces, I still greave Your Spirit, I still try to live without You. I need to trust You more and more, I need to look to you only, and not look else where.
